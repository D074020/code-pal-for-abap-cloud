# Contributing

## Code of Conduct

All members of the project community must abide by the [Contributor Covenant, version 2.1](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Only by respecting each other we can develop a productive, collaborative community.
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting [a project maintainer](.reuse/dep5).

## Contributing Code or Documentation

Contributions should be submitted as GitHub pull requests.

 - If you're working on a contribution that will resolve an issue, please claim that issue beforehand (by commenting on it) so that other people know you're working on it.
 - Contributions must be licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE)
 - For legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) when they create their first pull request to this project. This happens in an automated fashion during the submission process. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).

 See our [guide for code contributors](contributing-code.md) for coding style and architectural guidelines.

## Issues and Planning

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancement requests.

Please provide as much context as possible when you open an issue. In particular, when reporting a false positive or negative finding, always provide a code sample with which other contributors can reproduce that finding.
